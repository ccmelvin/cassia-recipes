            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Hi there! I'm Cassia, and cooking has been my passion for as long as I can remember. 
              What started as helping my grandmother in her kitchen has evolved into a lifelong 
              love affair with food, flavors, and the joy of sharing meals with others.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              This blog is my way of sharing that passion with you. Here, you'll find recipes 
              that range from quick weeknight dinners to special occasion treats, all tested 
              in my own kitchen and crafted with love. I believe that good food doesn't have 
              to be complicated â€“ it just needs to be made with care and the right ingredients.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What You'll Find Here</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Every recipe on this site comes with detailed instructions, helpful tips, and 
              honest notes about what works (and what doesn't!). I'm all about making cooking 
              approachable and fun, whether you're a beginner cook or a seasoned chef looking 
              for new inspiration.
