## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If recipes don't appear:
1. Check Sanity Studio has published recipes
2. Verify environment variables in `.env.local`
3. Check browser console for errors

### If images don't load:
1. Ensure images are uploaded in Sanity Studio
2. Check `next.config.ts` has Sanity CDN domain
